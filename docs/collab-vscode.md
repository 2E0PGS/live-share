## Collaborative Editing

TODO: Be sure to mention which VS Code extensions are required per type (e.g. c#) in addition to what is supported.

## Collaborative Debugging

## Additional Capabilities

## Known Participant Limitations

Every collaborative interaction consists of an "owner" who originated the collaboration session and one or more "participants." The owner is able to continue to operate as they always have but participants currently have some limitations that we hope to resolve over time.  A number of limitations are described in the right context above, so this section will focus on those limitations not already covered. 

See the [feature roadmap](roadmap.md) and [current open feature requests](https://github.com/Microsoft/project-cascade/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Afeature-request+sort%3Areactions-%2B1-desc) for additional details. Be sure to [up-vote the features you most want to see or create a new request](../CONTRIBUTING.md) if you don't see what you need.
