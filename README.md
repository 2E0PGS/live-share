# Project Cascade Documentation & Feedback

## Collaborative Coding
_Real-time collaborative development, using your own tools_

### Quick Start

Team collaboration should be so quick and natural, that it becomes harder not to do it! For this reason, "Project Cascade" makes it simple to get started, so that you can seamlessly begin sharing your work and ideas.

#### 1. Register with the "Project Cascade" service

While "Project Cascade" is in private preview, you'll need to request access to share. We'll be rapidly working through the waitlist, so expect to get an e-mail from us very soon after signing up! While waiting, you can carry on with steps #2, so that you're ready to share as soon as you're accepted!

> **Note:** _This step is only necessary in order to "share". Anyone can "join" a collaboration session as a participant by simply following the steps below. This makes it easy for folks to work together, without everyone needing to explicitly register._

**[Enroll now!]()** 

#### 2. Download the "Project Cascade" extension/installer for your tool
A core part of "Project Cascade" is enabling rich collaboration directly from your existing tools, and therefore, we provide integration for your favorite IDE/editor:

_Don't see your favorite IDE/editor? [Let us know!](https://github.com/Microsoft/project-cascade/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Afeature-request+sort%3Areactions-%2B1-desc) We plan to add support for additional tools based on community feedback._

#### 3. Sign-in from within your IDE/editor

Once you have the necessary client plugin installed, simply sign-in to the "Project Cascade" service, using the same GitHub or Microsoft account that you registered with. This allows your team to recognize you when collaborating with each other.

> **Tip:** Need to use a different sign-in for Visual Studio than your personalization account? Go to Tools &gt; Options &gt; Project Cascade.

#### 4. Share your code

Simply click the "Share" button within your tool, which will generate a link that allows others to join in your collaboration session.

#### 5. Send someone the invite link

Send the link over e-mail, Slack, Skype, etc. and once someone joins you can begin immediately editing with your team! 

> **Note:** The person you invite will be able to download, install needed tools, and join the collaboration session without having to enroll in the private preview.

#### 6. Share more as needed

Want some help with a build issue? Let your teammates seen your output logs! Want to collaboratively debug a tricky bug? Start debugging session! See the documentation below for additional details.

_If you find yourself needing to share something that isn't currently supported, [please let us know!](https://github.com/Microsoft/project-cascade/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Afeature-request+sort%3Areactions-%2B1-desc)_
