# Project Cascade Documentation & Feedback
Project Cascade is a code name for a collection of experimental developer services intended to enable developers to achieve greater confidence at speed. The inital focus is on Node.js and ASP.NET/ASP.NET Core based web applications and services with more coming in the future. _Interested in other languages or platforms? [Let us know!](https://github.com/Microsoft/project-cascade/issues/12)_

## Collaborative Coding
_Real-time collaborative development, using your own tools_

### Quick Start

Team collaboration should be so quick and natural, that it becomes harder not to do it! For this reason, Project Cascade makes it simple to get started, so that you can seamlessly begin sharing your work and ideas.

#### 1. Register with the Project Cascade service

While Project Cascade is in private preview, you'll need to request access to start a collaboration session. We'll be working through the wait list as fast as we can, so expect to get an e-mail from us after signing up! While waiting, you can carry on with step #2 so that you're ready to go!

> **Note:** _This step is only necessary in order to "share". Anyone can "join" a collaboration session as a participant. This makes it easy for folks to work together without everyone needing to explicitly register for the preview._

**[Register now!](http://aka.ms/project-cascade)** 

#### 2. Download the and install Project Cascade
Longer term you will be able to simply install an extension for any supported tool. However, you will need to follow these directions for your tool of choice during the Private Preview.

        <ul><li><a href="http://aka.ms/project-cascade">Download for Windows</a></li></ul>
        Start Visual Studio to complete setup.

        <li><a href="http://aka.ms/project-cascade">Download for macOS</a><br/></li></ul>
        Unzip the contents to a preferred location on your machine and launch VS Code from there to complete setup.

_Don't see your favorite IDE/editor? [Let us know!](https://github.com/Microsoft/project-cascade/issues/24) We plan to add support for additional tools based on community feedback._

#### 3. Sign-in from within your IDE/editor

Once installed, start up your tool sign-in to the Project Cascade service with the same creditals you used to register.

> **Tip:** Need to use a different sign-in for Visual Studio than your personalization account? Go to Tools &gt; Options &gt; Project Cascade.

#### 4. Share your code

Simply click "Share" within your tool and you'll get a link that allows others to join in your collaboration session.

#### 5. Send someone the invite link

Send the link over e-mail, Slack, Skype, etc. and once someone joins you can begin immediately working with them! 

> **Note:** The person you invite will be able to download, install needed tools, and join the collaboration session without having to register for the private preview.

#### 6. Share and collaborate

Start co-editing, highlight where a problem is, or let your teammates see your output logs! Want to collaboratively debug a tricky issue? Start a co-debugging session! See the documentation below for additional details.
