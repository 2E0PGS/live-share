# Security features of Live Share

## Connectivity

All connections in Visual Studio Live Share are SSH or SSL encrypted and authenticated against a central service to ensure that only those in the collaboration session can gain access to its content. By default, Live Share attempts a direct connection and falls back on a cloud relay if a direct connection between a given guest and the host cannot be established. In addition, Live Share's cloud relay does not persist any traffic routed through it and does not "snoop" the traffic in any way.

You can find more information about connectivity requirements and how to tweak these behaviors in the [connectivity requirements for Live Share](connectivity.md) article.

## Invitations and join access

Live Share's invitation links are generated for each collaboration session and ending the session results in the generation of a new invitation link. Therefore, the combination of time and the size and nature of the identifier in the link provides a solid overall base for security.

As a host, you are also notified whenever a guest joins the collaboration session and the fact that each participant needs to sign in using an existing Microsoft work or school account (AAD), personal Microsoft account, or a GitHub account means that you can feel confident that the person who has joined is in fact who they say they are.

<table style="border: none;">
<tr style="border: none;">
    <td width="50%" style="vertical-align: top; border: none;">
        <img src="../media/vscode-join-notification.png" width="100%" alt="Visual Studio Code join notification" />
    </td>
    <td width="50%" style="vertical-align: top; border: none;">
        <img src="../media/vs-join-notification.png" width="100%" alt="Visual Studio join notification"/>
    </td>
</tr>
</table>

Better still, the notification gives you the ability to "remove" a guest that has joined if for some reason you do not know who they are by simply hitting the remove button. (For example, if you posted your link on a company-wide chat system and a random employee joined).

### Requiring guest approval

While this default provides a good mix of speed and control, you may want to lock things down a bit more if you are doing something sensitive. Fortunately, by updating a setting, you can prevent guests from joining the collaboration session until you have explicitly "approved" them. Enabling it is easy.

* In **VS Code**, add the following to settings.json (File > Preferences > Settings):

        "liveshare.guestApprovalRequired": true

* In **Visual Studio**, set Tools > Options > Live Share > Require guest approval to True.

    ![Visual Studio settings window with guest approval setting highlighted](../media/vs-setting-guestapproval.png)

From this point forward you'll be asked to approve each guest that joins.

<table style="border: none;">
<tr style="border: none;">
    <td width="50%" style="vertical-align: top; border: none;">
        <img src="../media/vscode-join-approval.png" width="100%" alt="Visual Studio Code join approval request" />
    </td>
    <td width="50%" style="vertical-align: top; border: none;">
        <img src="../media/vs-join-approval.png" width="100%" alt="Visual Studio join approval request"/>
    </td>
</tr>
</table>

As a guest, if you join a session where the host has this setting enabled, you'll be notified in the status bar or join dialog that Live Share is waiting on the host to approve.

## Controlling file access and visibility

As a guest, Live Share's remote model gives you quick access to files and folders the host has shared with you without having to sync the entire contents of a project. As a host, an added advantage of this model is that you can opt to "exclude" files you do not want to share with anyone without sacrificing on functionality. Your guests can still participate in things like debuging sessions that would normally require access to these files if they wanted to do so on their own.

You can accomplish this by adding a **.vsls.json** file to the folder or project you are sharing. Any settings you add to this json formatted file then changes how Live Share processes files. In addition to providing you direct control, these files can also be committed to source control so anyone cloning a project will be able to take advantage of these rules with no additional effort on their part.

Here's an example .vsls.json file:

    {
        "gitignore":"none",
        "excludeFiles":[
            "*.p12",
            "*.cer",
            "token",
            ".gitignore"
        ],
        hideFiles: [
            "bin",
            "obj"
        ]
    }

Let's walk through how these properties change what guests can do.

### Properties

The **excludeFiles** property allows you to specify a list of glob file patterns (very much like those found .gitignore files) that should be excluded from ever being sent to guests. Be aware that this is inclusive of the guest *follows or jumping to your edit location, a file opening during collaborative debugging, or any code navigation features like go to definition, and more.* It is intended for files you never want to share under any circumstances like those containing secrets, certificates, or passwords. For example, since they control security, .vsls.json files are always excluded.

The **hideFiles** property is similar, but not quite as strict. These files are simply hidden from the file tree. If you happened to step into one of these files during debugging for example, it is still opened in the editor. This property is primarily useful if you do not have a .gitignore file setup (as would be the case if you are using a different source control system) or if you simply want augment what is already there to avoid clutter or confusion.

The **gitignore** setting establishes how Live Share should process the contents of .gitignore files in shared folders. By default, rules established in .gitignore files are treated as if they were specified in "hideFiles". Options are:

| Option | Result |
|--------|--------|
| `none` | .gitignore contents are not considered. |
| `hide` | **The default.** .gitignore contents are processed as if they were in the "hideFiles" property. |
| `exclude` | .gitignore contents are processed as if they were in the "excludeFiles" property. |

A downside of the `exclude` setting is that the contents of folders like node_modules are frequently in .gitignore but can be useful to step into during debugging. Consequently, Live Share supports the ability reverse a rule using "!" in the excludeFiles property. For example:

    {
        "gitignore":"exclude",
        "excludeFiles":[
            "!node_modules
        ]
    }

### .vsls.json files in sub-folders

Finally, just like .gitignore, .vsls.json files can be placed in sub-folders. Rules determined by starting with the .vsls.json file in the root folder you have shared (if present) and looking at each sub-folder leading to a given file to look for .vsls.json files to process. The contents of .vsls.json files in folders farther down the file tree supplement (or override) rules established at higher levels and are applied to the files at the appropriate level.
