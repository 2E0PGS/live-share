# Welcome to the Project Cascade Private Preview!

Thanks for installing Project Cascade for Visual Studio Code! Team collaboration should be so quick and natural, that it becomes harder not to do it! For this reason, Project Cascade makes it simple to get started, so that you can seamlessly begin sharing your work and ideas. 

## Sharing

You need to be registered in the Project Cascade Private Preview in order to start a collaboration session and share your code. If you're just looking to join a collaboration session, [jump below](#joining).

### 1. Sign-in from within your IDE/editor

Click on the "Sign in" status bar item. If you're enrolled in the private preview, use the creditals you used to register.

### 3. Send someone the invite link

Send the link over e-mail, Slack, Skype, etc. and once someone joins you can begin immediately working with them! 

Note that the **person you invite does not need to register for the private preview**. The web page for the invite link contains everything they need to know to download, install needed tools, and join the collaboration session. However, if they want to create their own collaboration sessions, they'll need to register.

### 4. Collaborate!

That's it!! Once the person you invited joins your collaboration session you're ready to go!

## Joining

Joining a collaboration session is easy!

### 1. Start a discussion with the collaboration session owner

It's always good to start up a conversation via voice or chat in your favorite client before joining a collaboration session since you'll obviously need to communicate to collaborate. In addition, the collaboration session requires the owner to be connected to the service for [a number of good reasons](../docs/getting-started.md#owners-and-participants) to operate so you'll want to check in with them.

### 2. Open/re-open the invite link in your web browser
After installing Project Cascade for your tool, simply open (or re-open) the invite web page using the invite link your college sent you.  You should be notified that your browser wants to launching your Project Cascade enabled tool and if you accept it the tool will launch and automatically start the process of joining the collaboration session.

> **Troubleshooting Tip:** Be sure you've **started the tool at least once** after installing Project Cascade before opening/re-opening the invite page. Still having trouble? See [manually joining](../docs/getting-started.md#manually-joining) in our docs.

### 3. Sign-in from within your IDE/editor

To let other collaborators know who you are, you may be asked to sign in during the join process using a GitHub or Microsoft account. If you are using Visual Studio and have already signed into the tool, Project Cascade will automatically use your personalization account if you've already signed into the tool so you can skip this step!

Any use of your sign in information complies with [Microsoft's privacy statement]().

### 4. Collaborate!

That's it! In a few moments you'll be in the collaboration session!
