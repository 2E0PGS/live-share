## Collaborative Editing

TODO: Note extensions that are required for features - e.g. C#

### Known Co-Editing Participant Limitations
Currently there are a number of shortcoming for this experience for developers that have joined a collaboration session (participants). Developers starting a collaboration session do not have these limitations.

You can use [this query](https://github.com/Microsoft/project-cascade/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue%20is%3Aopen%20label%3Afeature-request%20label%3A%22area%3A%20co-edit%22%20sort%3Areactions-%2B1%20) to find a complete list of logged limitations for co-editing. Up-vote (üëç) those you want the most and feel free to raise new issues if there is another limitation not covered already!

## Collaborative Debugging

### Known Co-Debugging Participant Limitations

Up-vote (üëç) those you want the most and feel free to raise new issues if there is another limitation not covered already!

## Additional Capabilities

## Additional Known Participant Limitations

Every collaborative interaction consists of an "owner" who originated the collaboration session and one or more "participants." The owner is able to continue to operate as they always have but participants currently have some limitations that we hope to resolve over time.  A number of limitations are described in the right context above, so this section will focus on those limitations not already covered. 

See the [feature roadmap](roadmap.md) and [current open feature requests](https://github.com/Microsoft/project-cascade/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aopen%20is%3Aissue%20label%3Afeature-request%20sort%3Areactions-%2B1%20) for additional details.
