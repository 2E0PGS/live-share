While ultimately an extension, follow these directions for installing Project Cascade during the Private Preview.

    </td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td style="width: 128px; text-align: center; border:none;"><img src="media/vscode-icon.png" /></td>
    <td>
        <strong>Visual Studio Code</strong><br />
        Download the Windows or Mac version of VS Code + Project Cascade. Unzip the contents to a preferred location and launch VS Code from there to complete setup.<br />

        <a href="http://aka.ms/project-cascade"><img src="media/download-for-mac.png"></a><br />
    </td>
</tr>
</table>

### 2. Reload the invite link in your web browser
After installing Project Cascade for your tool, simply reload the invite web page or click on the invite link again. You should be notified that your browser wants to launching your Project Cascade enabled tool and if you accept it the tool will launch and automatically start the process of joining the collaboration session.

> **Troubleshooting Tip:** If you're finding the web page isn't launching your Project Cascade enabled tool, be sure you've **started the tool at least once** after installing Project Cascade and try again. This will set up the handler. If you're still having trouble, see [manually joining](getting-started.md#manually-joining) in the getting started documentation.

### 3. Sign-in from within your IDE/editor

You'll may be asked to sign in during the join process using a GitHub or Microsoft account. This lets the person you are collaborating with know who you are. 

> **Note:** Visual Studio will automatically use your personalization account if you've already signed in! No further action is required.

All use of your sign in information adheres to [Microsoft's privacy statement]().
