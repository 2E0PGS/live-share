# Welcome to Visual Studio Live Share!

If you're here, one of the Visual Studio Live Share private limited preview members has probably **shared a collaboration session with you**! Team collaboration should be so quick and natural, that it becomes harder not to do it! For this reason, Visual Studio Live Share makes it simple to get started. 

Just follow these steps to join a collaboration session:

### 1. Download and install Visual Studio Live Share

### 2. Start a discussion with the Collaboration Session Host

It's always good to start up a conversation via voice or chat in your favorite client before joining a collaboration session since you'll obviously need to communicate to collaborate.

### 3. Open/re-open the invite link in your web browser

After installing Visual Studio Live Share for your IDE/editor, simply open (or re-open) the invite web page using the invite link your colleague sent you.  

You should be notified that your browser wants to launching your Visual Studio Live Share enabled tool and if you accept it the IDE/editor will launch and automatically start the process of joining the collaboration session.

> **Troubleshooting Tip:** When using VS Code, be sure you've **started the tool at least once** after installing Visual Studio Live Share before opening/re-opening the invite page. Still having trouble? See [manually joining](../docs/getting-started.md#manually-joining) in our docs.

### 4. Sign in from within your IDE/editor

To let other collaborators know who you are, you may be asked to sign in during the join process using a GitHub or Microsoft work, school, or personal account. 

If you are using Visual Studio and have already signed into the tool, Visual Studio Live Share will automatically use your personalization account so you can skip this step! If prefer to use a different sign-in than your VS personalization account, go to **Tools &gt; Options &gt; Live Share** to switch credentials. 

### 5. Collaborate!

That's it!! In a few moments you'll be connected to your colleague's collaboration session. Want to learn more about what you can do? Check out our documentation.
