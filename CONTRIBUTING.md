## Up-Voting Existing Problem Reports or Feature Requests
If you are wondering if someone has already encountered a problem or requested a feature you are interested in.  You can check out [open issues](https://github.com/Microsoft/project-cascade/issues) to see if the issue or feature request has already been filed. Use this [query](https://github.com/Microsoft/project-cascade/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Afeature-request+sort%3Areactions-%2B1-desc) to search for the most popular feature requests.

If you find your issue/feature already exists, feel free to make relevant comments and add your [reaction](https://github.com/blog/2119-add-reactions-to-pull-requests-issues-and-comments). Use a reaction in place of a "+1" comment.

## Filing Problem Reports or Feature Requests

### Filing Visual Studio Problems

Visual Studio has a built in feedback mechanism via the "Report a Problem..." tool that provides the engineering team detailed information about your installation that you should use to log bugs or problems you encounter when using VS.

Steps: 
1. As always, first search existing problem reports to see if one already exists.  
    - You may search for existing issues using "**Project Cascade**" in the Visual Studio Feedback tool.
    - However, be aware your problem may be related to multiple clients and therefore is logged in the GitHub [issue repository](https://github.com/Microsoft/project-cascade/issues).
2. If you find it, up vote it.
3. If not, create one using the Visual Studio Feedback tool and use "**Project Cascade:**" at the start of your title.

> **Note:** After it is filed, your problem report may be moved to a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/Microsoft/project-cascade/issues) for future tracking if it applies multiple clients or turns out to be a feature request. In this event, a link to the corresponding GitHub issue number will be referenced in comments on your raised problem report. 

Check out the tips in "Writing Good Problem Reports and Feature Requests" for additional suggestions.

### Filing VS Code or General Service Problems 

After ensuring there is not an [existing issue](https://github.com/Microsoft/project-cascade/issues), create an issue in [this repository](https://github.com/Microsoft/project-cascade/issues). 

Please include the following with each issue in addition to following the guidelines above for writing good bug descriptions.

* The product and version of the tool you are using
* Your operating system
* List of extensions that you have installed (if applicable). 

> **Tip:** You can easily add the list of extensions by creating the issue using `Report Issues` from VS Code's Help menu. 

* If in VS Code, errors in the Dev Tools Console (Help | Toggle Developer Tools)

### Filing Feature Requests
Many feature requests start out life as reported problems and should therefore follow the processes described above.  However, if you believe you have a feature request that is not a bug, you can follow these steps:

1. Use this [query](https://github.com/Microsoft/project-cascade/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Afeature-request+sort%3Areactions-%2B1-desc) to search for the most popular feature requests to see if it already exists.  
2. If so, 👍 (upvote) it.
3. If not, be as specific as you can be with the problem or scenario you are trying to solve with the requested feature and let us know any painful workarounds you are having to do.

As with problem reports, don't feel bad if we ask for more information while we try to understand your scenario.

### Tip: Writing Good Problem Reports and Feature Requests

Here are a few tips that will help us understand your problem or feedback quickly.  

> **Tip:** You may be able to save yourself some time by searching [issue repository](https://github.com/Microsoft/project-cascade/issues) to see if the problem/request already exists so you can simply up-vote it. 

First, try to file a single issue per problem or feature request.

* Do not enumerate multiple bugs or feature requests in the same issue.
* Do not add your issue as a comment to an existing issue unless it's for the identical input. Many issues look similar, but have different causes.

The more information you can provide, the more likely someone will be successful reproducing the issue and finding a fix. 

* Reproducible steps (1... 2... 3...) and what you expected versus what you actually saw. 
* Images, animations, or a link to a video. 
* A code snippet that demonstrates the issue or a link to a code repository we can easily pull down onto our machine to recreate the issue. 

Don't feel bad if we can't reproduce the issue and ask for more information!
