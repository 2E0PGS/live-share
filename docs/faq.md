|**Q:** _What is Project Cascade?_ |**A:** Project Cascade is a code name for a set of experimental services designed to help individuals and teams better achieve confidence at speed. The first service we are investigating is a real-time collaboration service designed to bring collaborative development into the core development process in your own tools. The service and its client integrations let you share your project context rather than just your screen. You get a bi-directional, instant, and familiar way to jump into opportunistic "ad-hoc pair programming" in your tool without being forced to look at the same file, viewport, etc. Editing is only part of the story. With Project Cascade, you can collaboratively edit and debug seamlessly and securely on a shared working copy of a project using your workflow and the comfort of your IDE/editor.|
| **Q:** _How is my code shared with other participants?_ | **A:** Participants access code directly on owner's machines via secured cloud service. Only files that are actually edited are transmitted to participants and none of these files are stored in the cloud. All operations on the code are remoted in a controlled way which enables instance access, go-to-definition, intellisense, and search without the contents of the files actually being on the participant's machine or stored in the cloud. Once the collaboration session / share is stopped by the owner further access is terminated. Unlike screen sharing which gives complete desktop control, the specific asset that is shared is highly controlled providing added security.
| **Q:** _Does this remote based model work anywhere?_ | **A:** The only requirement is that the owner and each participant have internet access and can connect to the Azure based service.  No special peer-to-peer connection is required. |
| **Q:** _What happens when the session owner goes offline?_ | **A:** While this model provides instant access and improved security by enabling the owner to cut off access to the code completely at any point, the downside is that the owner needs to be online and connected to the service for participants to connect. |
| **Q:** _What kind of session access controls are available?_ | **A:** During the private preview the non-guessable invite link provides the primary mechanism to prevent unexpected users from joining the session. Users must also sign in using a GitHub or Microsoft supported work, school, or personal Microsoft account which gives the owner visibility to who is connected. As mentioned above, access can be cut off by simply ending the collaboration session and the session is not kept running if the owner shuts down their tool or signs out. As we move forward we intend to expand role based access controls to enable further security. Up-vote the features you most want to see [here](http://aka.ms/project-cascade/feature-requests).|
| **Q:** _How is terminal access controlled?_ | **A:** Given terminal access provides additional permissions to participants the owner must explicitly start one. The owner may shut down access at any point by simply shutting down the terminal. As mentioned previously, the owner also needs to be online and connected to the service and all participants are required to sign in to provide visibility to the owner on who is connected. No special ports are opened and the interaction is entirely facilitated via the secure service. Unlike screen sharing which gives complete desktop control, the specific asset that is shared is highly controlled providing added security. |
| **Q:** _How is debug, browser, and local server access controlled?_ | **A:** For security reasons the owner needs to take a specific action to enable any of these scenarios. The owner controls starting the debugging session that participants connect. Browser access to the running application is facilitated via the service operating on a known port specified by the IDE/editor or the owner. The owner can opt to share additional ports if they so choose (e.g. for a RESTful API) and has complete control to shut down access as needed. Participants cannot start any of these actions. Again, the owner also needs to be online and connected to the service and all participants are required to sign in to provide visibility to the owner on who is connected. Unlike screen sharing which gives complete desktop control, the specific asset that is shared is highly controlled providing added security. |
| **Q:** _What advantages does this service have over screen sharing?_  | **A:** Screen sharing inherently means one person is in control and everyone watching is locked in on a fixed view. While you can hand off control with some solutions, there is no ability to easily, independently investigate issues or browse the code to get more context without impacting the person doing the sharing. From a security perspective, personal messages, email notifications, and other information can appear and be visible to all participants and the person in control is given complete access to the entirety of the desktop environment or shared application.  Further, the tool and desktop configuration is optimized for the person sharing which can lead to confusion. Latency is also a common problem particularly when trying to edit or perform other rapid interactions or when describing a problem as collaborators tend to move around quickly assuming that the person on the other side is seeing everything. <br /> <br /> Project Cascade let you share your project context rather than just your screen. You get a bi-directional, instant, and familiar way to jump into opportunistic "ad-hoc pair programming" in your tool without being forced to look at the same file, viewport, etc. Editing is only part of the story. With Project Cascade, you can collaboratively edit and debug seamlessly and securely on a shared working copy of a project using your workflow and the comfort of your IDE/editor. Improved security is achieved by enabling control over what exactly is shared through simple and familiar gestures localized to the tool. That said, Project Cascade is not intended to replace screen sharing scenarios like looking through tool menus and in fact is expected to be used with collaboration tools with voice, video, and screen sharing capabilities. It is about concurrent, real-time collaboration rather than just providing a way to display a visual.|
|**Q:** _What advantages does this service have collaboration tools like Slack and Microsoft Teams?_ | **A:** Project Casacde is designed to be used in conjunction with these technologies not replace them.  Most collaborative interactions will begin in these tools and get to a point where it is simply to difficult to explain a problem in words or through snippets and single files and full context is needed. These interactions can be anything from seeking help on a design question or bug, to collaboratively working through a design, pair programming, or simply doing an ad-hoc peer review before a commit or PR. The combination of co-editing, co-debugging and other features elevate the discussion to a new level. While these tools also provide screen sharing capabilities there are a number of downsides to them as outlined above. | 
| **Q:** _How is this different from a Web IDE with collaborative capabilities?_ | **A:** With web IDEs, both the owner and participants need to be using the tool to get collaborative benefits. While it is feasible for participants to tactically switch tools, owners operate in an ecosystem of tools typically anchored in a desktop environment. As a result, many do not feel they are adequate to operate as their primary development environment. Further, Web IDEs assume that you are building and deploying in a VM in a cloud environment which has both performance downsides and in some cases security implications.  With Project Casacde the owner gets the full capabilities of their own ecosystem of tools while providing participants access to the same types of capabilities available in Web IDE environments. Co-debugging works against the owner's actual environment which can be useful in tracking down problems that only happen there while still avoiding the perf hits of running in the cloud. |
