# Welcome to the Visual Studio Live Share Private Preview!

If you're here, you've probably been **accepted into the private preview**! If not, see how to **[join an existing collaboration session](welcome-joiner.md)** with **no registration required** or **[register now](http://aka.ms/vsls-signup) so you can share**!

Team collaboration should be so quick and natural, that it becomes harder not to do it! For this reason, Visual Studio Live Share makes it simple to get started, so that you can seamlessly begin sharing your work and ideas. 

Just follow these steps to start sharing:

### 1. Download and install Visual Studio Live Share for your tool

By downloading and using Visual Studio Live Share, you agree to the [license terms](http://aka.ms/vsls-license) and [privacy statement](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/privacystatement/EnterpriseDev/default.aspx).

### 2. Sign-in from within your IDE/editor

Once installed, start up your tool sign-in to the Visual Studio Live Share service with the same creditals you used to register.

> **Tip:** Need to use a different sign-in for Visual Studio than your personalization account? Go to Tools &gt; Options &gt; Visual Studio Live Share or use "Share As..." in the next step.

### 3. Start a collaboration session and share your content

Open a folder, project, or solution, and simply click "Share" within your tool and an invite link will be automatically copied to your clipboard. When opened in a browser, this link allows others to join a new collaboration session that shares contents of these folders with them.

> **Tip:** If you need to use alternate credentials for this sharing session only, you can right click on the Share button and select "Share As...".

### 4. Send someone the invite link

Send the link over e-mail, Slack, Skype, etc. and once someone joins you can begin immediately working with them! 

Note that the **person you invite does not need to register or be accepted in the private preview**. The web page for the invite link contains everything they need to know to download, install needed tools, and join the collaboration session. (However, they will not be able to _create_ their own collaboration sessions until they've been accepted in the preview.)
