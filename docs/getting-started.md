# Getting Started

## Owners and Participants
All collaboration activities in Project Cascade involve a single "owner" with one or more "participants."  The owner is the person that started the collaboration session and therefore not only owns the session but is the content being shared as well.  Participants then are anyone that joins an owner's collaboration session.

Owners can use all of their tools and services as they would normally but participants are only given access to the specific things the owner has shared with them. This includes code, running servers, debugging sessions and more.  Currently all content that is shared is kept on the owner's machine and not synchronized to the cloud or on the participant's machine which enables _instant access_ and _increased security_. 

The advantage is that the entire solution is available the moment a participant joins and the moment an owner ends a collaboration session, the content is no longer available to any participant. While content will not be available to participants if the owner's machine has offline/shut down during a session, the collaboration session will automatically start up again for participants when the owner's machine is back online and the tool is re-opened.
