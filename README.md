The initial focus of Visual Studio Live Share is <strong>real-time collaborative development of Node.js and ASP.NET/ASP.NET Core based web applications and services</strong> with more coming in the future. It is currently in a limited, private preview.

## Quick Starts

- [Start a collaboration session](welcome/welcome-owner.md) (after you've been accepted into the preview)
- [Join a collaboration session](welcome/welcome-joiner.md) (no need to register or be accepted)

## Documentation 
- [Getting started and managing collaboration sessions](docs/getting-started.md)
- [Visual Studio enabled features](docs/collab-vs.md) 
- [Visual Studio Code enabled features](docs/collab-vscode.md) 
- [Roadmap](docs/roadmap.md)
- [FAQ](docs/faq.md)

## Register with the Visual Studio Live Share service

While Visual Studio Live Share is in its experimental private preview phase, you'll need to request access to **start** a collaboration session and share your content. We'll be working through the wait list as fast as we can, so expect to get an e-mail from us when you've been accepted! 

> **Note:** _This step is only necessary in order to "share". Anyone can "join" a collaboration session as a participant. This makes it easy for folks to work together without everyone needing to explicitly register for the preview._

If you're a Visual Studio user be sure to use your [personalization account](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/ide/signing-in-to-visual-studio) credentials to register to make sign in fast!
