# Linux installation details

Linux is a highly variable environment and with the sheer number of desktop environments and distributions can be complicated to get working. If you stick to supported versions of **Ubuntu Desktop** (16.04+) or **Fedora Workstation** (27+) and only use **official distributions of VS Code** , you should find the process straight forward. However, in the event that you are using a non-standard configuration or downstream distribution, you may or may not run into some hiccups. This document provides some information on requirements and some troubleshooting details that might help you get up and running even if you configuration is only community supported.

## Install Linux prerequisites

Some distributions of Linux are missing libraries Live Share needs to function. By default, Live Share attempts to detect and install Linux prerequisites for you. You'll see a toast notification when Live Share encounters a problem that can originate from missing libraries asking you for permission to install them.

![Toast notification showing message that Linux pre-requisites are missing](../media/vscode-linux-prereq-missing.png)

When you click "Install", a terminal window will appear where you'll need to enter your admin (sudo) password to continue. Assuming it completes successfully, restart Visual Studio Code you should be all set! You may also want to check out **[tips by distribution](#tips-by-distribution)** for other hints and workarounds if any exist.

If you see a message indicating the script does not support your distribution, see **[tips for community supported distributions](#tips-for-unsupported-distros)** for information the community has shared with us.

If you **prefer not to have VS Code run the command for you**, you can also opt to re-run the very latest version of this script at any time manually by running the following command from a Terminal window:

    wget -O ~/vsls-reqs https://aka.ms/vsls-linux-prereq-script && bash ~/vsls-reqs

### Details on required libraries

> **Critical Note:**  Using Live Share on any distribution of Linux will require **curl/libcurl with Kerberos support** compiled in it or you will see sign in failures. Supported distributions have this support in their base libcurl/curl packages, but if you've custom compiled curl be sure Kerberos support is included. Other unsupported distributions may require additional steps.

#### Debian / Ubuntu

Visual Studio Live Share uses the .NET Core runtime which requires a number of libraries be installed. The following libraries are required for Debian/Ubuntu based distributions or derivatives:

- libunwind8
- liblttng-ust0
- libcurl3 (Ubuntu 16.04, 17.10, Mint 18.3, Debian 9) or libcurl4 (Ubuntu 18.04)
- libssl1.0.0 (Ubuntu 16.04, 17.10, 18.04) or libssl1.0.2 (Debian 9)
- libuuid1
- libkrb5-3
- zlib1g
- libicu55 (for Ubuntu 16.04, Mint 18.3), libicu57 (for Ubuntu 17.10, Debian 9), or libicu60 (for Ubuntu 18.04)
- gettext
- apt-transport-https
- gnome-keyring
- libsecret-1-0
- desktop-file-utils
- x11-utils

> **Critical Note:** Be sure you do **not** have both **libssl1.0.0 and libssl1.0.2 installed** or the Live Share agent may crash. Use `sudo apt remove libssl1.0.0` to remove the older version if both are installed. See [here](https://github.com/dotnet/core/issues/973) for additional information on this .NET Core bug.

Libraries may be installed on Debian/Ubuntu based distributions by running `sudo apt install <library-name>` in a terminal. For Ubuntu 16.04, 17.10, and Mint 18.3 run:

    sudo apt install libssl1.0.0 libcurl3 libunwind8 liblttng-ust0 libuuid1 libkrb5-3 zlib1g gnome-keyring libsecret-1-0 desktop-file-utils gettext apt-transport-https x11-utils libicu??

For Ubuntu 18.04, run:

    sudo apt install libssl1.0.0 libcurl4 libunwind8 liblttng-ust0 libuuid1 libkrb5-3 zlib1g gnome-keyring libsecret-1-0 desktop-file-utils gettext apt-transport-https x11-utils libicu??

For Debian 9, run:

    sudo apt install libssl1.0.2 libcurl3 libunwind8 liblttng-ust0 libuuid1 libkrb5-3 zlib1g gnome-keyring libsecret-1-0 desktop-file-utils gettext apt-transport-https x11-utils libicu??

#### Fedora / CentOS / RHL

Fedora/CentOS/RHL requires similar packages to Debian / Ubuntu but with slightly different names:

- libunwind
- lttng-ust
- libcurl
- openssl-libs
- libuuid
- krb5-libs
- libicu
- zlib
- gnome-keyring
- libsecret
- desktop-file-utils
- xorg-x11-utils

Libraries may be installed on Fedora/CentOS/RHL based distributions by running `sudo yum install <library-name>` in a terminal. For example, this will install everything:

    sudo yum install libunwind lttng-ust libcurl openssl-libs libuuid krb5-libs libicu zlib gnome-keyring libsecret desktop-file-utils xorg-x11-utils

Other distributions will require the same libraries, but the package names may be subtly different. You can [read more about .NET Core 2.0 prerequisites for other distributions here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/linux-prerequisites?tabs=netcore2x#linux-distribution-dependencies).

## Linux browser integration

Visual Studio Live Share typically **does not require additional installation steps** to enable browser integration on Linux.

To accomplish this, Live Share automatically places a desktop file in `~/.local/share/applications` and the required launcher itself in `~/.local/share/vsliveshare` when the extension first initializes. No action is required on your part if this succeeds.

In some cases, distributions either do not support this location or require tweaks to get it to work with their vanilla installs (e.g. CentOS 7). In these cases, Live Share falls back to using `/usr/local/share` instead. As a result, **you may be notified that your admin (sudo) password is required** to complete the installation process. A terminal window will appear telling you where the browser launcher will be installed. Simply enter your password when prompted and press enter once the installation completes to close the terminal window.

If you'd prefer to run the command yourself instead, you can click "Copy instead" which will copy the terminal command to the clipboard instead.

Finally, if you opt to skip this step entirely, you can still [join collaboration sessions manually](../use/vscode.md#join-manually), but you will not be able to join by opening an invite link in the browser. Note that you can always access the command again later, by hitting **Ctrl+Shift+P / Cmd+Shift+P** and selecting the "Live Share: Launcher Setup" command.

## Tips by distribution

While the prerequisite install script above should cover Debian / Ubuntu and RHL / Fedora / CentOS, you may be wondering what is typically missing from vanilla installations of these distributions. The following list shows the key libraries that were missing in a fresh install of the distribution. The list also provides some tips that can help you get up and running if you hit a problem.

> **Note:** One critical note for all distributions is that you will need a version of curl/libcurl with Kerberos support in it or you will see sign in failures even after dependencies are installed. Supported distributions have this support in their libcurl/curl packages, but if you've custom compiled curl be sure Kerberos support is included.

See **[tips for community supported distributions](#tips-for-community-supported-distros)** for information about whether certain non-Debian / Ubuntu or RHL based distributions are working or not.

Note that the Linux ecosystem moves quickly and package names will be different in certain distributions, so your results may vary. Additional details can be found above on the libraries Live Share needs.

## Tips for community supported distros
<a name="tips-for-unsupported-distros"></a>

Distributions outside of the Debian / Ubuntu or RHL trees are not officially supported by Visual Studio Code or .NET Core. Therefore, by extension, they are not officially supported by Visual Studio Live Share either. However, the community has contributed some useful information about getting Live Share up and running on a number of additional distributions.

> **PRs welcome:** If you're interested in updating this information with your favorite distribution, submit a PR for [this file](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/live-share/tree/master/docs/reference/linux.md) in our docs GitHub repo. Even better, if you'd like to get the dependency installer supporting your favorite distribution, you can submit a PR [for this file](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/live-share/blob/master/scripts/linux-prereqs.sh).

### VS Code OSS Issues

> **ArchLinux/Manjaro Users:** Use the [visual-studio-bin](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/visual-studio-code-bin) AUR package to avoid this problem.

Packages of Visual Studio Code that are either vanilla or modified versions of VS Code OSS can be missing a critical value in `product.json` file that prevents Visual Studio Live Share from activating.

A quick way to see you might be hitting this problem is to go to Help > "Toggle Developer Tools" and see if you find a stack trace indicating the Live Share extension did not activate because it was using a "proposed API."

To verify this is your issue, check the contents of `product.json`. The file's location does vary by package, but it is usually in one of the following locations:

- `/usr/share/code/resources/app/product.json`
- `/usr/share/vscode/resources/app/product.json`

If the `extensionAllowedProposedApi` property is missing or you do not see "ms-vsliveshare.vsliveshare" referenced, you are using an OSS version with this problem. **Contact the VS Code distribution owner to get the issue patched.**

As a **workaround**, you can add the following into the product.json:

        "extensionAllowedProposedApi": [
          "ms-vsliveshare.vsliveshare",
          "ms-vscode.node-debug",
          "ms-vscode.node-debug2"
    Â ]

See [above](#tips-for-community-supported-distros) for additional details on whether the distribution you are using is known to work.
