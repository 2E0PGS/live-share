# Welcome to the Project Cascade!

One of the Project Cascade Private Preview members has **shared a collaboration session with you**! Team collaboration should be so quick and natural, that it becomes harder not to do it! For this reason, Project Cascade makes it simple to get started. Here's some quick start steps so you can get collaborating!

### 1. Download and install Project Cascade for your tool
While ultimately an extension, follow these directions for installing Project Cascade during the Private Preview.

    <td>
        <strong>Visual Studio 2017</strong><br />
       - Install VS 2017 on Windows (7, 8.1, or 10) then download and run the Project Cascade installer. <br />
       - Start Visual Studio after install to complete setup.<br />

    <td>
        <strong>Visual Studio Code</strong><br />
        - Download the combined Code + Cascade zip for Windows (7, 8.1, or 10) or Mac (macOS Sierra <i>only</i>).<br />
        - Unzip it where you want the install to live and start VS Code from there to complete setup.<br />

</tr>

### 2. Open/re-open the invite link in your web browser
After installing Project Cascade for your tool, simply open (or re-open) the invite web page using the invite link your college sent you.  You should be notified that your browser wants to launching your Project Cascade enabled tool and if you accept it the tool will launch and automatically start the process of joining the collaboration session.

> **Troubleshooting Tip:** Be sure you've **started the tool at least once** after installing Project Cascade before opening/re-opening the invite page. Still having trouble? See [manually joining](getting-started.md#manually-joining) in our docs.

### 3. Sign-in from within your IDE/editor

To let other collaborators know who you are, you may be asked to sign in during the join process using a GitHub or Microsoft account. If you are using Visual Studio and have already signed into the tool, Project Cascade will automatically use your personalization account if you've already signed into the tool so you can skip this step!

Any use of your sign in information complies with [Microsoft's privacy statement]().

### 4. Collaborate!

That's it!! In a few moments you'll be connected to your colleague's collaboration session. Want to learn more about what you can do? Check out our documentation.
