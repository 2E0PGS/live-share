# Project Cascade Documentation & Feedback
Project Cascade is a code name for a collection of experimental developer services intended to enable developers to achieve greater confidence at speed. The inital focus is on **Node.js (VS Code) and ASP.NET/ASP.NET Core (VS/VS Code) based web applications** and services with more coming in the future.

_Interested in other languages or platforms? [Let us know!](https://github.com/Microsoft/project-cascade/issues/12)_

## Collaborative Coding
_Real-time collaborative development, using your own tools_

Team collaboration should be so quick and natural, that it becomes harder not to do it! For this reason, Project Cascade makes it simple to get started, so that you can seamlessly begin sharing your work and ideas.

### Register with the Project Cascade service

While Project Cascade is in private preview, you'll need to request access to **start** a collaboration session and share your content. We'll be working through the wait list as fast as we can, so expect to get an e-mail from us when you've been accepted! 

> **Note:** _This step is only necessary in order to "share". Anyone can "join" a collaboration session as a participant. This makes it easy for folks to work together without everyone needing to explicitly register for the preview._

If you're a Visual Studio user be sure to use your [personalization account](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dn457348.aspx) credentials to register to make sign in fast!
